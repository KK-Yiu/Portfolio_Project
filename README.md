# Portfolio_Project
1. (DL) ANN model on loan repayment Project

Given historical data on loans in The lendingClub obtained from Kaggle, an Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) model with 89% accuracy is built to predict whether a borrower will pay back the loan.
Potentially, the model could reduce the time of assesement of loan request and avoid bad loans.

2. (ML) Survival prediction on classic titanic dataset

Using the classic titanic dataset in Kaggle competition to predict the survival of passengers, four machine learning models (logistic regression,Decision tree,Random forest, Support vector machine) are used and compared with accuracy score, classification report and confusion matrix.
The result of SVC model with the best estimator is better than the other three models.

3. Amazon web scraping project

A web scraping project by python beautifulSoup library is created so I could track the price of a hairclay that I would like to buy for a specific period of time. Hence, I could wait until the best price appears.

4. Data analysis project on Bellabeat

Data from smart products of Bellabeat are obtained from Kaggle and analyzed to provide insight on how people are using the devices. The main purpose would be providing marketing strategy to the stackeholders of Bellabeat through the analysis of the data.
